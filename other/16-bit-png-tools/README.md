16 Bit Color Depth PNG Tools
============================

Generate PNG image files with 16 bit color depth per channel.
The script relies on [png-coder](https://github.com/achillessin/png-coder) which seems to support 16 bit png properly.

The 16 bit png support in image editing software is not very reliable (Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, etc.)

## Usage

```javascript
// TODO
```
